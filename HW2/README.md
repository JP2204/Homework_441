This weeks introduction to JavaScript was a nice and easy week for me, most of what was talked about I remember from creative coding last semester so this was a nice refresher to the material. I had no issues with the assignment for this week and it was really nice to go though and have no hiccups along the way, I think that's a first for me in my coding experience so far. This was a good starting point and I look forward to diving more in depth into JavaScript as the semester goes on.
