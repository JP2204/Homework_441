This weeks assignment was pretty fun, working with JavaScript in a DOM was a little difficult at first because it has been a couple of months since the last time I worked in JavaScript, but once I got going it became a nice refresher. I think the hardest part was trying to figure out and come up with a story that would be fun to interact with. But I Can not wait to work on this story more in the coming weeks.
