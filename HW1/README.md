Going into this week I felt fairly confident, and honestly I thought this assignment was going to be nice and easy. Boy was I mistaken, it's not that the assignment itself was hard it was that my memory and knowledge of how to go about certain things like making containers and how to syle with css was hazy to say the least. I had to go back through some old assignments from 341 as well as look though the book to refresh my mind. This took some time and is what took the longest with this assignment, because once I started typing and things began to work it all sort of came back to me, and I was able to create something I am fairly happy with in a fairly short amount of time, especially compared to when I first started. It also helped that I took a look at Michaels example in order to figure certain things out with my own site. So at the end of the day what started as a frustrating struggle slowly and happily turned into an enjoyable and fun experience.
