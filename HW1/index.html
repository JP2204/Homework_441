      <h2>Who is James Pierce?</h2>

      <p>My Name is James Pierce and I am Senior Majoring in Media Arts, I love cars and my goal car would have to be a Nissan R34 Skyline. The weird thing about this car is that it is actually illegal in America until 2024 due to some silly laws made in the 90's</p>
      <p>I origanilly went to school to be an athletic trainer but I quickly got bored of that and wanted to try my hand at something I have never really done before.</p>
      <p>Thats what drew me to Media Arts because I have never really created anything before let alone used programs like Photoshop, premiere, or after effects before, and that really intigued me. So I went and changed my major and have not looked back since, the ability to learn and obtain new skills while having the freedom to create pretty much whatever I wanted was something I never knew I wanted.</p>
      <p>So now going into my last semester I have gained not only the skills to be a good creative but also the confidnce to create without worry of judgment.</p>

      <h2>Inspiration and Goals</h2>

      <p>I have always loved watching youtube and was always interested in editing and creating videos but I never knew where to start so that never happened. After learning different film techniques and working with editing software it made me really appreciate my favorite creators even more and has made me more excited to create than ever before. So my insipration is those creators that I watch on a daily basis and my goal is to be on there level one day.</p>
      <p>Speaking of goals, I have a few that I have set for my future self. My first goal is to hone my skills to become the best creator and artist I possibly can, by always learning and trying new thigns and not being afraid of failure. My second goal is one I mentioned in the section above and that is to own my goal car, and I would love to be able to make videos on it and document the life of GTR owner.</p>

      <h2>Why Me?</h2>

      <p>So why should someone pick me to create some work for them? Well it is really simple I am very driven and willing to fail and learn from that failure. If I do not know how to do something you can trust and believe that I will not stop until I figure it out and deliver the vision you came to me with.</p>
