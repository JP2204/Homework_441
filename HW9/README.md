This assignment had a lot info that took a while to digest and comprehend. I was able to get my jsonquery.html to work seamlessly but I ran into issues with my other html files. For my idex.html I was not getting any errors but nothing was popping up on the page for me and I could not dissect the reason why. For my ajax.html I kept getting an error regarding my txt file which said that a CORS request was not an http, which I was not able to figure out how to fix. I looked at my code and everything look like how it was supposed to look, but I just cannot figure out the solutions.
