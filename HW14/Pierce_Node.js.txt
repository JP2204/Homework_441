My experience with node.js was pretty straight forward for the most part, all the concepts needed are what we have been learning all semester so that part was pretty easy. Although it was pretty straight forward there was a lot of content to digest which took the most time for this week, just the reading and the different steps were a lot. I was able to get my page to work and I definitely noticed the positives for the server, loading to page 2 seemed almost instant compared to one of our previous assignments. The only issue I ran into was I was not able to get the text to change to what the client put into the text boxes. After experiencing node.js it fits right into what we have been learning and the theme of making everything efficient.
